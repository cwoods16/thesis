Mental Accounting in College: Students' use of "Free Money"

In the accompanying .Rmd file, I visualize and statistically analyze Pomona College students' use of FLEX dollars (prepaid college monetary credit for discretionary use) at the Coop Store, a a takeout-style store on campus selling snacks, sandwiches, and other miscellaneous items.

Visualizations consist of FLEX usage during various weeks of 2 semesters: Spring 2019 and Fall 2019

Statistical analysis involves Chi Squared Tests, broken down by transaction volume vs. purchase volume. The observed data will be examined against 2 null hypotheses - one being the optimal spending strategy of consistent use throughout the semester, and the other modeling students perceived FLEX usage as acquired in an online survey.

Results will be discussed in final product - this project solely involves data analysis portion
